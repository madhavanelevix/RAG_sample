    "\n",
    "The \"doubling\" happens because your graph state (the list of messages in memory) likely accumulated duplicates during the retries or previous save attempts, and the previous PostgresCheckpointSaver logic blindly appended everything it thought was \"new\" based on counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this permanently, we need a smarter put method that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleans the incoming list to remove internal duplicates (e.g., [A, B, A, B] becomes [A, B]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Checks content signatures against the database to ensure we never save the same message content twice for the same thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have updated the postgres_checkpointer.py below with this Robust Deduplication Logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Updated File: postgres_checkpointer.py\n",
    "How this solves the duplication:\n",
    "DB Signature Check: It queries the database for all existing (type, content) pairs for the current thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strict Filtering: Before saving a message, it checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it empty? -> Skip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it tool or system? -> Skip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it already in the DB? -> Skip (This stops the infinite \"re-saving\" loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it a duplicate within the current batch? -> Skip (This fixes cases where the graph state itself has [A, B, A, B]).\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that only unique, new content is ever added to your langgraph_messages table, keeping your token usage stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Since your database currently has corrupted data, run TRUNCATE TABLE langgraph_messages CASCADE; in your PostgreSQL tool before starting the server with this new code. This will give you a clean slate."
